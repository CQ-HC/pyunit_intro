This project folder is meant to give a nice introduction to pyUnit
unittest in a "Hello World" fashion, if you will.

There are two main unittest programs:
   * intro.py  --  This is a very simple test to get started with
   * unittest_run_all.py -- This is showing how to group files and run all

Here's an overview of all the files and folders included in this project.
    +- pyunit_intro
       |- intro.py
       |- README
       +- suite
          |- README
          +- src
             |- add.py
             |- __init__.py
             |- subtract.py
             +- text
                |- goodbye.py
                |- hello.py
                |- __init__.py
             +- trig
                |- __init__.py
                |- sincos.py
          +- test
             |- unittest_run_all.py

Running intro.py is where I would recommend starting.  Simply run the command:

    python intro.py

If successful, you'll recieve the following output:

    ...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 3 tests in 0.000s
    
    OK

This shows that three tests (three dots) were ran successfully.

As far as documentation goes, the source code is the documentation.  If you're
thirsty for additional knowledge beyond what I've described, I would recommend
the following resources:
